<h1>I am a simple boy from Kenya</h1>
  <p>Hello there, my name is Otile Brown and I am a Kenyan guy who lives in Finland. I am currently studying and hope to finish soon before I am too Finnished. Get it? Hahaha!</p>
  <p>Okay, I will teach you a few things about where I am Kenya where I am from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kenya" target="_blank" title="It's my pride and joy man! "> About this weird country you've never heard of </a>
  </p>

<h3> But first a little bit about the even weirder country that I live in.</h3>
  <p>I have absolutely no idea where to start with this country called Finland, there is so much to talk about, but I would like to tell you a little about a great sport they call <a href="https://youtu.be/TAOY7fdVHCg" target="_blank" title="It is amazing you should try it!"> <i>eukonkanto</i></a>. A great many people have tried this sport but failed. Only Finnish couples with the spirit of  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sisu" target="_blank" title="Rumour has it the spirit of the warriors!"><i>sisu</i></a> have succeeded in it.</p>
  <p>Just remember the eukonkanto makes wives look like this! </p>
